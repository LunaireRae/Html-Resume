        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ravyn Luna and it is nice to meet you. I am here trying to get a jr web developer position, so that I can develop my skills as a web developer and move from IT, to pursue a remote position and also do something I find more fun to do. The idea of creating something has always fascinated me. I will be moving to France in mid-late 2024, so I would like to find a remote position US based before I leave.</p>
